### Summary

The Liberty App Accelerator provides a starting point for creating applications running on [WebSphere Liberty](https://developer.ibm.com/wasdev/).

To deploy this application to IBM Cloud using a toolchain click the **Create Toolchain** button.
[![Create Toolchain](https://console.ng.bluemix.net/devops/graphics/create_toolchain_button.png)](https://console.ng.bluemix.net/devops/setup/deploy/)

### Requirements
* [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/install.html)
* Java 8: Any compliant JVM should work.
  * [Java 8 JDK from Oracle](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html)
  * [Java 8 JDK from IBM (AIX, Linux, z/OS, IBM i)](http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/java/jdk/),
    or [Download a Liberty server package](https://developer.ibm.com/assets/wasdev/#filter/assetTypeFilters=PRODUCT)
    that contains the IBM JDK (Windows, Linux)

### Configuration
The application is configured to provide various technologies and features. These capabilities are provided through dependencies in the pom.xml file and Liberty features enabled in the server config file found in `src/main/liberty/config/server.xml`.

### Project contents
The context root is set in the `src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/ibm-web-ext.xml` file. The ports are set in the pom.xml file. 

* **MicroProfile** : The [MicroProfile project](http://microprofile.io/) is an open community with the aim of optimizing Enterprise Java for a microservices architecture.  MicroProfile will be evolving with guidance from the community. For the complete feature documentation, see the [microProfile-1.2](http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSEQTP_liberty/com.ibm.websphere.wlp.nd.multiplatform.doc/ae/rwlp_feature_microProfile-1.2.html) feature description in IBM Knowledge Center. If you want to share your thoughts you can post straight to the [MicroProfile Google group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/microprofile).        

The project contains IBM Cloud specific files that are used to deploy the application as part of an IBM Cloud DevOps flow. The `.bluemix` directory contains files used to define the IBM Cloud toolchain and pipeline for your application. The `manifest.yml` file specifies the name of your application in IBM Cloud, the timeout value during deployment and which services to bind to.

### Run

To build and run the application:
1. `mvn install`
1. `mvn liberty:run-server`
 

To deploy the application to IBM Cloud:
1. `mvn install -Pbluemix -Dcf.org=[your email address] -Dcf.username=[your username] -Dcf.password=[your password]`

The application will be deployed to the following url: [http://LibertyProject.mybluemix.net/LibertyProject/]
